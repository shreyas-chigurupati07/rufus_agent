We strongly recommend having one letter from a math/science teacher, and one from a humanities, social science, or language teacher. Additionally, a letter is often submitted by a counselor or school official alongside the required Secondary School Report. We have always said that it is most important to get these letters from the people who know you best and can advocate most compellingly on your behalf, whether or not they have taught you the most recently or in the most advanced coursework. While we strongly prefer letters of recommendation from different academic areas of study, we understand that this may be more challenging for some students due to their curriculum. You should do your best and use your judgment in asking for letters of recommendation.In some cases, you may ask a teacher who you thought should be able to provide a letter, however they are not able to do so. We understand that unexpected circumstances arise and your preferred recommender may be struggling with their own challenges and may be unable to write you a letter. We encourage you to try to get letters of recommendation from people who can write well on your behalf, or to at least have them fill out the cover sheet component with an abbreviated letter if necessary. But don't stress about this;as always, students will not be penalized in the application process for disruptions outside of their control, and there will be ample space in the application to explain any issues you may have had in getting your letters.One thing that teachers can do to help us (and you) is make explicit in their letters any constraints on them that might prevent them from writing a typically strong or knowledgeable letter on your behalf. A few sentences at the top of a letter describing any limited capacity should be sufficient. Feel free to link this FAQ to your teachers when you ask for their letters (which we recommend that you do politely, and early), as well as ourother suggestions for writing strong letters.First-year application FAQsSee allFirst-year application questionsSearch ResultsFAQ/First-year applicationWhat if I don't have letter grades for some of my coursework or have chosen to take a class pass/fail?At MIT Admissions, we understand that there have been many disruptions over the past few years.

Grades that are pass/fail give us confidence you have the minimum proficiency in a course to successfully pass.Please remember that no matter which type kind of grades you send, they are only one piece of the overall application. We look at other factors such as testing, what your teachers say, etc., in order to understand your academic preparation for MIT.
